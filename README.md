## üéØ Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of calculus in computing volumes of solids of revolution. It uses the **disk method** to calculate the volume when a function is rotated around an axis, specifically implementing the calculation for:

**Function:** $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$  
**Rotation:** Around the x-axis  
**Interval:** $[0, 5]$

The volume is calculated using the formula:

$$V = \pi \int_{0}^{5} [f(x)]^2 \, dx$$

The script not only computes the numerical volume with precision but also generates an interactive 3D visualization of the solid using parametric surface plotting.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üî¢ Symbolic Mathematics**: Uses SymPy to compute exact volume integrals symbolically before numerical evaluation
- **üé® Interactive 3D Visualization**: Creates beautiful, rotatable 3D surface plots of solids of revolution
- **üìä Parametric Surface Generation**: Generates mesh grids using polar coordinates for accurate surface representation
- **‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Functions**: Easily modify the function, integration bounds, and visualization parameters
- **üìà High-Quality Output**: Produces professional visualizations with proper axis labels, titles, and color mapping
- **üßÆ Exact Calculation**: Leverages symbolic integration for mathematically precise results

## üî¢ Mathematical Background

The volume of a solid of revolution is a fundamental concept in calculus. When a continuous function $f(x)$ is rotated around the x-axis from $x = a$ to $x = b$, the volume of the resulting solid is given by:

$$V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx$$

This is known as the **disk method**, which conceptually slices the solid into infinitesimally thin circular disks perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Each disk has:
- **Radius**: $r = f(x)$
- **Area**: $A = \pi [f(x)]^2$
- **Volume**: $dV = \pi [f(x)]^2 \, dx$

Integrating these infinitesimal volumes gives us the total volume of the solid.

### üéì For This Project

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ rotated around the x-axis from $x = 0$ to $x = 5$:

$$V = \pi \int_{0}^{5} (x^3 - 3x + 1)^2 \, dx$$

The script uses SymPy's symbolic integration to compute this exactly, yielding:

**Volume ‚âà 25,221.38 cubic units**

### üìê Visualization Method

The 3D surface is generated using **parametric equations** in cylindrical coordinates:
- **x-coordinate**: Direct linear spacing along $[0, 5]$
- **y-coordinate**: $y = f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ at each x
- **z-coordinate**: $z = y \cdot \cos(\theta)$ for rotation
- **w-coordinate**: $w = y \cdot \sin(\theta)$ for rotation

Where $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ completes the full revolution around the x-axis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

The script is designed to be easily customizable for different functions and intervals.

### Changing the Function

1. **Open** `3d_Volume_Calculation.py` in your text editor
2. **Locate** the function definition (line 7-8):
   ```python
   x = symbols('x')
   f = x**3 - 3*x + 1  # Modify this line
   ```
3. **Replace** with your desired function, for example:
   ```python
   f = x**2  # Parabola
   f = np.sin(x)  # Sine wave
   f = x**2 + 1  # Shifted parabola
   ```

### Adjusting Integration Bounds

1. **Locate** the integration line (line 11):
   ```python
   integral = integrate(f**2, (x, 0, 5))  # Change (0, 5)
   ```
2. **Modify** the bounds `(0, 5)` to your desired interval:
   ```python
   integral = integrate(f**2, (x, -2, 3))  # New interval [-2, 3]
   ```

### Updating the Visualization

1. **Update** the plotting range (line 16):
   ```python
   X = np.linspace(0, 5, 250)  # Match your integration bounds
   ```
2. **Modify** the function in the plotting section (line 17, 22):
   ```python
   Y = X**3 - 3*X + 1  # Update to match your function
   Y_grid = (X_grid**3 - 3*X_grid + 1)  # Update here too
   ```

### Example: Different Function

To calculate the volume of $f(x) = \sin(x)$ from $0$ to $\pi$:

```python
# Define the function
f = sin(x)

# Compute the volume
integral = integrate(f**2, (x, 0, pi))

# Update plotting
X = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 250)
Y = np.sin(X)
Y_grid = np.sin(X_grid)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Code Structure

The script follows a clear, modular structure:

```python
# 1. Import Dependencies
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sympy import symbols, integrate, pi

# 2. Define the Function (Symbolic)
x = symbols('x')
f = x**3 - 3*x + 1

# 3. Calculate Volume (Symbolic Integration)
integral = integrate(f**2, (x, 0, 5))
volume = pi * integral

# 4. Generate Parametric Surface (Numerical)
X = np.linspace(0, 5, 250)  # 250 points along x-axis
theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)  # 100 points around revolution
X_grid, Theta = np.meshgrid(X, theta)
Y_grid = (X_grid**3 - 3*X_grid + 1)
Z_grid = Y_grid * np.cos(Theta)
W_grid = Y_grid * np.sin(Theta)

# 5. Render 3D Surface
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X_grid, Z_grid, W_grid, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.8)
```

### Key Components
