## Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of calculus in computing volumes of solids of revolution. It uses the **disk method** to calculate the volume when a function is rotated around the x-axis, computing the integral and generating an interactive 3D visualization of the resulting solid.

**Current Implementation:**
- **Function:** $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$
- **Rotation:** Around the x-axis
- **Interval:** $[0, 5]$
- **Volume Formula:** $V = \pi \int_{0}^{5} [f(x)]^2 \, dx$

## Features

- **Symbolic Mathematics**: Uses SymPy to compute exact volume integrals symbolically before numerical evaluation
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Creates beautiful, rotatable 3D surface plots of solids of revolution
- **Parametric Surface Generation**: Generates mesh grids using polar coordinates for accurate surface representation
- **Customizable Functions**: Easily modify the function, integration bounds, and visualization parameters
- **High-Quality Output**: Produces professional visualizations with proper axis labels, titles, and color mapping
- **Exact Calculation**: Leverages symbolic integration for mathematically precise results

## Mathematical Background

The volume of a solid of revolution is a fundamental concept in calculus. When a continuous function $f(x)$ is rotated around the x-axis from $x = a$ to $x = b$, the volume of the resulting solid is given by:

$$V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx$$

This is known as the **disk method**, which conceptually slices the solid into infinitesimally thin circular disks perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Each disk has:
- **Radius**: $r = f(x)$
- **Area**: $A = \pi [f(x)]^2$
- **Volume**: $dV = \pi [f(x)]^2 \, dx$

Integrating these infinitesimal volumes gives us the total volume of the solid.

### For This Project

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ rotated around the x-axis from $x = 0$ to $x = 5$:

$$V = \pi \int_{0}^{5} (x^3 - 3x + 1)^2 \, dx$$

The script uses SymPy's symbolic integration to compute this exactly, yielding:

**Volume ≈ 25,221.38 cubic units**

### Visualization Method

The 3D surface is generated using **parametric equations** in cylindrical coordinates:
- **x-coordinate**: Direct linear spacing along $[0, 5]$
- **y-coordinate**: $y = f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ at each x
- **z-coordinate**: $z = y \cdot \cos(\theta)$ for rotation
- **w-coordinate**: $w = y \cdot \sin(\theta)$ for rotation

Where $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ completes the full revolution around the x-axis.

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0PKunal/3d-Volume-Calculation.git
```

2. **Then change the directory:**
```bash
cd 3d-Volume-Calculation
```

 **Install required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib sympy
```

### Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **numpy** | Numerical computations, array operations, and mesh grid generation |
| **matplotlib** | Creating 3D plots, visualizations, and surface rendering |
| **sympy** | Symbolic mathematics and exact integration |

> **Note:** If you're using Anaconda, these packages are typically pre-installed.

## Usage

### Basic Execution

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python 3d_Volume_Calculation.py
```

## Output

When executed, the script will:

1. **Calculate the volume** using symbolic integration
2. **Print the result** to the console with high precision
3. **Generate and display** an interactive 3D visualization

**Example Console Output:**
```
Volume: 25221.37902144463 cubic unit
```

The visualization window shows the solid generated by rotating $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ around the x-axis over the interval $[0, 5]$.

## Customization

You can easily modify the script to calculate volumes for different functions and intervals:

### Changing the Function

Edit the function definition in `3d_Volume_Calculation.py`:

```python
# Define your custom function
x = symbols('x')
f = x**2 + 1  # Change this to your desired function
```

### Changing the Integration Interval

Modify the integration bounds:

```python
# Compute the volume with custom bounds
integral = integrate(f**2, (x, a, b))  # Change a and b
volume = pi * integral
```

### Adjusting Visualization

Customize the plot appearance:

```python
# Adjust resolution
X = np.linspace(0, 5, 500)  # Increase for smoother surface
theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 200)  # Increase for better circular definition

# Change colormap
ax.plot_surface(X_grid, Z_grid, W_grid, cmap='plasma', alpha=0.9)  # Try 'plasma', 'inferno', 'cool'
```
