## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of calculus in computing volumes of solids of revolution. It uses the **disk method** to calculate the volume when a function is rotated around an axis, specifically implementing the calculation for:

**Function:** $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$  
**Rotation:** Around the x-axis  
**Interval:** $[0, 5]$

The volume is calculated using the formula:

$$V = \pi \int_{0}^{5} [f(x)]^2 \, dx$$

The script not only computes the numerical volume with precision but also generates an interactive 3D visualization of the solid using parametric surface plotting.

## ✨ Features

- **🔢 Symbolic Mathematics**: Uses SymPy to compute exact volume integrals symbolically before numerical evaluation
- **🎨 Interactive 3D Visualization**: Creates beautiful, rotatable 3D surface plots of solids of revolution
- **📊 Parametric Surface Generation**: Generates mesh grids using polar coordinates for accurate surface representation
- **⚙️ Customizable Functions**: Easily modify the function, integration bounds, and visualization parameters
- **📈 High-Quality Output**: Produces professional visualizations with proper axis labels, titles, and color mapping
- **🧮 Exact Calculation**: Leverages symbolic integration for mathematically precise results

## 🔢 Mathematical Background

The volume of a solid of revolution is a fundamental concept in calculus. When a continuous function $f(x)$ is rotated around the x-axis from $x = a$ to $x = b$, the volume of the resulting solid is given by:

$$V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx$$

This is known as the **disk method**, which conceptually slices the solid into infinitesimally thin circular disks perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Each disk has:
- **Radius**: $r = f(x)$
- **Area**: $A = \pi [f(x)]^2$
- **Volume**: $dV = \pi [f(x)]^2 \, dx$

Integrating these infinitesimal volumes gives us the total volume of the solid.

### 🎓 For This Project

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ rotated around the x-axis from $x = 0$ to $x = 5$:

$$V = \pi \int_{0}^{5} (x^3 - 3x + 1)^2 \, dx$$

The script uses SymPy's symbolic integration to compute this exactly, yielding:

**Volume ≈ 25,221.38 cubic units**

### 📐 Visualization Method

The 3D surface is generated using **parametric equations** in cylindrical coordinates:
- **x-coordinate**: Direct linear spacing along $[0, 5]$
- **y-coordinate**: $y = f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$ at each x
- **z-coordinate**: $z = y \cdot \cos(\theta)$ for rotation
- **w-coordinate**: $w = y \cdot \sin(\theta)$ for rotation

Where $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ completes the full revolution around the x-axis.
